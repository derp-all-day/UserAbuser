This is a re-write of my friend Mayo's game for him.
Original: https://github.com/SirBothersome/UserAbuser

Side Notes#
###########
- "goto"is bad practice, it encourages stringy messy code.
- ALWAYS validate input, don't want any nasty buffer h3cks 
going on ;) Also, alphabetic values for the second question 
simply crash the program.
- OOP is ALWAYS best
